# A* search algorithm in reachability graphs of place-timed Petri nets
A* search algorithm in reachability graphs of place-timed Petri nets for Robotic Cellular Manufacturing systems.
It can deal with the nets with tokens' remaining times, alternative routings, generalized arcs, and multiple resource copies.

They are developed via C#.
